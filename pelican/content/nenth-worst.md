## Timeline 1: Nen Turns the Tables (L, CLE 15-14 FLA)

Timeline 1 was a high-scoring back-and-forth game; in the top of the 8th the Marlins were sitting
pretty with a 10-6 lead. Their chances of winning were pegged at over 90%. But Florida had a 
nightmare inning in the bottom of the 8th, with Felix Heredia giving up a 2-run blast to Sandy Alomar Jr.
that made it 10-8. 

Nen came in to relieve Heredia, and gave up a single, allowed a run to score on a wild pitch, then gave up
a 2-run home run to Matt Williams. But Nen wasn't done; he then walked a batter, then gave up a single
and an RBI double before he was forcibly removed from the game, which the Marlins were now losing 10-13.

From the time that Nen entered the game, to the time when he was removed, the probability of the Marlins
winning the game dropped from around 80% to below 5%. While the Marlins would mount a comeback in the top
of the 9th, scoring 4 runs to take a 1 run lead, the Indians would rally for 2 and a walk-off win in the
bottom of the 9th.

## Timeline 26: Nen Blows a Pitchers Duel (L, CLE 2-1 FLA)

In Timeline 26, a pitcher's duel, Leiter lasted for 7 innings, striking out 6 and giving up
just 1 run; Nagy struck out 8 in just 6 1/3. The game was tied 1-1 going into the ninth.

With Rob Nen on the mound for Florida in the bottom of the ninth, Matt Williams reached first base on an error
by Jim Eisenreich (LF), and advanced to second when Nen gave up a single. Nen gave up another single to left field
to Bip Roberts, and Williams charged home and dove under the catcher's tag in a dramatic walkoff play at the plate.
