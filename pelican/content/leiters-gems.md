## Timeline 26: 7 Innings, 6 Strikeouts (L, CLE 2-1 FLA)

In Timeline 26, a pitcher's duel, Leiter lasted for 7 innings, striking out 6 and giving up
just 1 run; but Nagy struck out 8 in just 6 1/3, and the game was tied 1-1 going into the
bottom of the ninth.

With Rob Nen on the mound for Florida, Matt Williams reached first base on an error by Jim Eisenreich (LF),
and advanced to second on a single. Bip Roberts hit another single to left, and Williams charged home
and dove under the catcher's tag in a dramatic walkoff play at the plate.

## Timeline 52: 7 Innings, 5 Strikeouts (W, FLA 7-1 CLE)

Timeline 52 saw a solid performance by Leiter, who struck out 5 over 7 innings; Cleveland's only run
scored came off of a solo home run by Sandy Alomar Jr. in the bottom of the 4th.
It was also one of the rare few times than the stars aligned to allow _both_ a solid performance
by Leiter, _and_ run support from Florida's batting order; for Florida it's typically one or the other.

## Timeline 53: 8 Inning 2-Hitter (L, CLE 3-2 FLA)

Pitching a two-hitter into the 8th inning, the Marlins had a 2-1 lead going into
the 9th. Rob Nen took over for Leiter in relief, and gave up a walk to David
Justice. On a single by Sandy Alomar Jr., Justice stretched for third and was safe.
A wild pitch by Nen allowed Justice to score from third base, and Alomar Jr. reached
3rd on a sacrifice fly.

With the game tied 2-2, and 2 outs in the bottom of the ninth,
