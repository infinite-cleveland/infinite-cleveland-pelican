## Timeline 3: 1 Out Shy of a Complete Game Shutout (W, CLE 6-0 FLA)

Shutting down the Florida offense, Charles Nagy came 1 out shy of pitching a complete game
shutout, with Brian Anderson coming on in relief for the very last out. Nagy struck out 8
and walked only 2. Anderson only came on in relief to help Nagy out of a two-on, two-out,
bottom-of-the-ninth jam, and Cleveland notched a shutout victory against Florida.

## Timeline 46: Complete Game 2-Hitter (W, CLE 7-0 FLA)

In a dominant performance, Nagy pitched a complete-game 2-hitter
in Timeline 46, holding the Marlins to just 3 total bases
and striking out 6.

It took 109 pitches for Nagy to put away the Marlins for good,
and Nagy was backed up by solid run support from Cleveland,
starting early with Thome's 2-run home run off Al Leiter.
